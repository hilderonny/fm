        <p>
           WebDav can be used for file browsing and document retrieval remotly over the internet using Windows file explorer. 
           This module provides an alternative visulaization of the content of the documents module, but suppurts only a subset 
           of possible interactions. Documents and folders <b>can be viewed, renamed and retrieved</b>, but they cannot be deleted or reallocated. 
           The creation of new documetns and folders is currently also not supported.

        <h2><a name="login">Login</a></h2> 
        <img src="/css/images/Webdav_Setup.png"/> 
        <p> 
            Simmilar to the user login procedure for the web application, the data access via WebDav server happens after user authentication.
            First of all, the user has to make a connection to WebDav server using the Windows <i> map network drive</i> interface.
            This is done by specifying the <b>webdav server Url</b>, which has the following format: <b>\\hostName@SSL@portNumber\DavWWWRoot</b>.
            In the particular case, the hostName is <b> TODO </b> and the portNumber is <b> 56789 </b>. After the connection is done successfully, 
            the user cradintial must be entered. The full login procedure is explanied in details below. <br>          
            <ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>From the <b>Start Menu</b> on Windows PC go to <b>File Explore</b> and right click on <b>This PC</b>.</li>
                    <li>Select <b>map network drive</b> from the drop list</li>
                    <li>From the pop up window, Enter <b>\\hostName@SSL@portNumber\DavWWWRoot</b> in the <b>folder</b> filed.</li>
                    <li>click <b>Finish</b></li>
                </ol>
            </ul>   
        </p>           
        <img src="/css/images/WebDav_login.png"/>     
        <p> The login window will pop up after clicking on th finish button in the previous step.The user name and password has to be entered in 
            order to complete the user authentication. Keep in mind that sometimes the login window
            takes a couple of seconds to get opened.                        
        </p> <img src="/css/images/WebDavView.png"/>        

        <p> <b>Attention!</b><br>Due to security reasons, the Windows WebDav client only supports single-user connection. This means that
             multiple connections to a server using different user credentials are not allowed. However, it is possible to make a connection 
             with different credentials by disconnecting the previous one and reconnecting with the new credentials.
        </p><br><br>

        <p>To <b>logout</b> means to disconnect from the WevDav server. The following steps explain how to logout: 
        <ul>
            <ol>
                <li>From the list of <b>Network locations</b> in Windows file explorer right click on the currently mapped WebDav shared drive.</li>
                <li>From the drop-down list select <b>Disconnect</b>.</li>
                <li>Click <b>Ok</b> to confirm the disconnection.</li>
                <li>Click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
                <li>Refresh the browser to see the changes</li>
            </ol>
        </ul> 
        </p><img src="/css/images/Webdav_logout.png"/>
        
        <p><b>Changing credentials</b> means that the user can login as a different user. However, this can happen only after disconneting from the current WebDav connection.
        Afterwards, the same login procedures as explained above must be followed. The one significant difference here is that users should check the 
        <b>connect using different credentials</b> checkbox (as shown on the image). 
        </p><img src="/css/images/change_credential.png"/>


        <h2><a name="specifics">Specifics</a></h2> 
        <p>Users should be aware of the following system behavior: 
            <ul>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Nested Hirarchy:</b> the same folder or document with the same name can appear repeatedly at different locations in the hierarchy.
                        This design is different than the typical Windows file system, which most users are familiar with.  
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Update on-Demand:</b>when any changes are made in the web application after login to WebDav, these will not automatically appear in the WebDav 
                        folder. The updated become visible only after the user manually refreshes the file browser.
                        For example if an image is deleted in the web application but the user forgot to refresh the file browser, an attempt to open this deleted image
                        will result in a error message or a low quality cashed preview. <b>Please, refresh the browser regularly!</b> </li> 
                </ol>
            </ul> 
        </p>


        <h2><a name="limitation">Limitations</a></h2> 
        <p>The deletion, creation, and reallocation of a folder/document is not supported.
            Regarding the deletion, due to the automatic bahviour of the Windows WebDav cleint, the user may try to delete a folder or a document and get misleading visual feedback. 
            It will look as if the deletion has been completed, although in reallity this action is prohibited by the server. Afer refreshing the file browser, the temporarily "deleted"
            data item will reapear again. 
            Additionally, error messges will apper when the user tries to creat or reallocate a folder or a document. Such messages should be ignored.        
        </p>
