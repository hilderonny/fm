            <ul>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Nested Hirarchy:</b> a same folder or document with a same name can be appeared several times at the same or different folder list in the browser 
                    depends on its dependency. it is crucial, to know that this document or folder is not a copy of the original one but the it is the orignal itself. Therefore, any updates made 
                    in one of them will be made to othere one of the same folder or document</li>

        <p>Deleting,creating,and renaming a folder/document are not supported. Regarding the deletion, the user can delete a folder or a file but this is not a real deletion 
        because the deleted file or folder will be shown again in the borwser since it has been refreshed or the user logged in again. This occured because the deletion
        does not effect the database. 
        Error messges is appered when trying to creat or rename a folder or a document.This messages has to be ignored.
